<p>The public mind has to a large extent
reacted against the opinions impressed
on it during the war by official propaganda.
Some of these have been overcome
by counter-propaganda in the
Press and on the platform; others have
been dropped because they led to effects
which, though admirable during a war,
were undesirable in peace-time. But,
as chemical warfare will not assume importance
until the outbreak of the next
serious war, and figures on the programme
of no party, people still think
about it as they were told to think by
the newspapers during the Great War.</p>

<p>Now, I am to some extent a chemist,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
so I can no more be expected to be impartial
in my estimate of the value of
chemistry than a politician or a clergyman
can be expected to give an unbiassed
view of the value of politics or
religion. I can only plead that, unlike
the average clergyman or politician, I
have warned my audience in advance,
and shall attempt (though no doubt
vainly) to be impartial.</p>

<p>A few of my hearers hold the view
that, while war in itself is a noble occupation,
the use of poisonous gas is an
innovation as cruel as it is unsoldierly.
The majority are probably pacifists in
the sense that they prefer almost any
peace to almost any war, support the
League of Nations or other devices for
the prevention of international strife,
and look askance at preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
future warfare, more particularly for
future chemical warfare. If so, I certainly
share their objection to war, but
I doubt whether by objecting to it we
are likely to avoid it in future, however
lofty our motives or disinterested our
conduct. War will be prevented only
by a scientific study of its causes, such
as has prevented most epidemic diseases.
For many centuries people had guessed
that epidemic diseases constituted a
punishment for human misconduct of
some kind. They tried to prevent them
by prayer and almsgiving. Christians
gave up washing, Hindus liberated rats
captured during plague-epidemics.
Religious orders and priests of the
church gave the most magnificent
examples of self-sacrifice in times of
pestilence. But that was not the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
in which pestilences can be prevented.
Besides good intentions, a special type
of accurate thinking was needed. We
have not yet made a scientific study of
the causes of war, and, until we do, may
expect more wars. If we are to have
more wars, I prefer that my country
should be on the winning side. That
is why I am speaking on warfare to my
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>In general, pacifists are a very great
military advantage to Britain. On the
outbreak of war the large majority of
them become intensely patriotic, whereas
beforehand they lead our own military
authorities and also those of our
potential allies and enemies to underestimate
our strength. This keeps us
out of some wars, and leads to our
showing unsuspected power in others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
After a few years of war, when the
originally bellicose politicians like Lord
Lansdowne are getting tired, ex-pacifists
like Lloyd George and Pitt have
just got into their stride. The national
staying-power is thus greatly increased.
I need hardly remark that future governments
will not enter on war without
first persuading the vast majority of
the people of its justice. This appears
to be a relatively simple process under
modern conditions.</p>

<p>At the present moment, however,
pacifists are combining with the less
competent soldiers in an attempt to
check the progress of chemical warfare.
This I believe to be neither in our
national nor in the international
interest.</p>

<p>Until 1915 the soldier’s business was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
to push or throw pieces of metal at the
enemy. Various devices had been employed
for throwing them fast or far,
and some of them threw other pieces on
arrival at their destination, thanks, in
the main, to the genius of the unforgotten
Major-General Shrapnel. It is
true that early in the eighth century
A.D. the appropriately named Syrian
Callinicus had prolonged the life of
the Eastern Roman Empire for another
750 years and saved a large part
of Christendom from Mahommedan
domination by his invention of “Greek
fire,” an inflammable liquid which was,
however, later superseded by gunpowder.
In the fifteenth century the
defenders of Belgrade against the Turks
had hit upon a similar device, under the
direct inspiration, it was claimed, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Holy Ghost, but these weapons had
fallen into desuetude, their effect being
largely psychological.</p>

<p>Chemical warfare had been so far
foreseen by statesmen that in 1907 the
signatories of the Hague Conference
agreed to renounce the use of projectiles
the sole object of which was the diffusion
of asphyxiating or harmful gases.
They were thus debarred from using
lachrymatory gas, the most humane
weapon ever invented; but permitted to
discharge gas from cylinders on the
ground, an exceedingly cruel practice.
This regulation was well meant, but the
path to August, 1914, was paved with
good intentions. In 1914 none of the
great powers had made any preparation
for poison-gas warfare, and it was not
till April 22nd, 1915, more than eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
months after the beginning of the war,
that the Germans began its use.</p>

<p>During the war, twenty-five different
poisonous weapons were employed. Of
these only three are gases at ordinary
temperatures, and can be discharged
from cylinders in which they are stored
under pressure. The remainder are
liquids which gradually evaporate,
yielding a poisonous vapour, or solids
which are poisonous in the form of
smoke.</p>

<p>These poisonous substances so far
used fall into four classes according to
their effect on men. First come gases
and vapours which are poisonous when
breathed, but have no effect on the skin,
and affect the eyes or nose only when
present in concentrations which are
poisonous to the lungs. They can all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
be kept out by respirators, and were
of military value only against unprotected
troops, or in local surprise-action.
This group, which included
chlorine and phosgene, are probably
almost as obsolete as muzzle-loading
cannon.</p>

<p>A second group are poisonous only
in very high concentrations, but irritate
the eyes when present in amounts so
small that one part in five million may
render a man blind with weeping in a
few seconds. There is no evidence, so
far as I know, that anyone was killed
or even permanently blinded by these
substances; but they had a great
momentary effect. They can be kept
out by respirators, or even goggles.</p>

<p>The third group of poisonous
smokes, mostly arsenic compounds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
were little developed during the war.
They are, however, weapons of very
great efficiency, and it is well known
that they would have been used by the
British at any rate on a very extensive
scale in 1919.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> In small amounts, these
smokes merely make one sneeze. In
somewhat larger amounts they cause
pain of the most terrific character in
the head and chest. The pain in the
head is described as like that caused
when fresh water gets into the nose
when bathing, but infinitely more
severe. These symptoms are accompanied
by the most appalling mental
distress and misery. Some soldiers
poisoned by these substances had to be
prevented from committing suicide;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
others temporarily went raving mad,
and tried to burrow into the ground to
escape from imaginary pursuers. And
yet within forty-eight hours the large
majority had recovered, and practically
none became permanent invalids. These
substances, when in the form of smoke,
will penetrate any of the respirators
used in the late war, though the
British box-respirator would stop all
but a little of them in the concentrations
then used. In future they will probably
be used in much larger concentrations
and in finer particles than those formed
by the German smoke-shells. It is extraordinarily
difficult to produce a respirator
which will completely stop very
fine smoke, for the following reason.
In a gas the molecules (or ultimate
particles) are moving very rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
with speeds of several hundred yards
per second, continually colliding and
rebounding. A gas molecule, therefore,
will probably hit the sides of a
fairly narrow passage through which
it is drawn. But a smoke particle is
moving at a speed measured in inches
per second, and is far less likely to hit
the wall of the respirator, and be held
by its absorbent surface. If we try to
make the passages through which air is
drawn very narrow, as by sucking in
our air through cotton-wool (which
will stop most smokes), we find that
we have created an appalling resistance
to breathing. There is an electrical
method of removing smoke-particles
completely, but it would probably more
than double the weight of respirators,
and does not appear to be either water-proof
or fool-proof.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> The American “Lewisite,” of which so much
was heard in 1918 and 1919, is a substance of
this class.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>The fourth group, of blistering
gases, contains only one substance used
during the war, dichlorethyl sulphide,
or “mustard gas.” This is really a
liquid, whose vapour is not only poisonous
when breathed, but blisters any
part of the skin with which it comes
into contact even. To take an example,
a drop of the liquid was put on a piece
of paper and left for five minutes on
a man’s sleeve. The vapour penetrated
his coat and woollen shirt, causing a
blister the effects of which lasted six
weeks. And yet evaporation is so slow
that ground contaminated by the liquid
may remain dangerous for a week.
Mustard gas caused more casualties to
the British than all other chemical
weapons put together.</p>

<p>Such are the weapons which chemistry
has given us. It is often asked why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
chemists cannot produce something
which will put our foes comfortably to
sleep and allow us to take them prisoners.
The answer is that such substances
exist, but that in small amounts
they are harmless, in large amounts
fatal. It is only over a moderate range
of concentrations that their effect is
merely stupefying. One has only to
think of the familiar case of chloroform
vapour, and the skill required to
give neither too much nor too little.</p>

<p>It would be logical to speak of
explosives under the heading of chemical
warfare, but there is curiously
little chance of explosives becoming
any more effective. We know fairly
well the maximum amount of energy
which can possibly be got out of a
chemical action, and, though explosives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
might perhaps be made which were
about twice as destructive as our best
(or worst) to-day, they would probably
be far less stable, and therefore
less safe to their users.</p>

<p>Of course, if we could utilize the
forces which we now know to exist inside
the atom, we should have such
capacities for destruction that I do not
know of any agency other than divine
intervention which would save humanity
from complete and peremptory
annihilation. But the remoteness of
the day when we shall use these forces
may best be judged by an analogy.
Some thousands of years ago someone
first realized that the sun, moon and
stars were not mere bodies as large as
a plate or a house, but very large, and
moving very fast. It was an obvious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
idea that their motions might be exploited
in some way. Wise men observed
them and hoped, for example, to
increase the probability of success in
their own enterprises by beginning them
when Jupiter was in the ascendant.
These attempts were unsuccessful,
though far more valuable to humanity
than most of the methods successfully
employed for the same purposes, such as
fraud, violence and corruption. They
led to astronomy, and so to all modern
physics. We now know that the only
probable way of harnessing the kinetic
energy of the heavenly bodies is to
employ tidal power to create electric
currents. But five thousand years ago
“hitching one’s wagon to a star” was a
reasonable project and not a poetic
metaphor. The reason we cannot do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
it is a simple matter of scale. And the
reason why we cannot utilize subatomic
phenomena is just the same. We cannot
make apparatus small enough to
disintegrate or fuse atomic nuclei, any
more than we can make it large enough
to reach to the moon. We can only
bombard them with particles of which
perhaps one in a million hit, which is
like firing keys at a safe-door from a
machine-gun a mile away in an attempt
to open it. We do occasionally open
it, but the process is very uneconomical.
It may be asked why we cannot bring
our machine-gun nearer, or improve
our aim. To do this we should require
to construct apparatus on the same infinitesimal
scale as the structure of the
chemical atom. Now we can arrange
atoms into various patterns. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
example, we can arrange carbon, hydrogen
and oxygen atoms in patterns
which constitute the molecules of
sugar, glycerine, or alcohol at will.
This is called chemical synthesis. We
have been doing it by rule-of-thumb
methods for thousands of years, and
are just beginning to learn a little
about it. But even chemical molecules
are much too large for our purposes.
We can no more ask a chemist to build
our apparatus than expect a theatrical
scene-painter or a landscape-gardener
to do us a miniature. We know very
little about the structure of the atom
and almost nothing about how to
modify it. And the prospect of constructing
such an apparatus seems to
me to be so remote that, when some
successor of mine is lecturing to a party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
spending a holiday on the moon, it
will still be an unsolved (though not,
I think, an ultimately insoluble)
problem.</p>

<p>To see how chemical weapons are
likely to be used in future we must
study their employment in the late war.
Lachrymatory gas was only once used
under ideal conditions—by the Germans
in the Argonne in 1915. They
captured a fairly extensive French
trench system and about 2,400 prisoners,
almost all unwounded, but temporarily
blind. When they gave the
number of prisoners, the French
authorities not unnaturally protested
that this number was practically equal
to the total of their casualties. And
this was quite true. The French were
unprotected. They were deluged with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
shells giving off a vapour which
temporarily blinded them. They could
not even run away. The Germans
walked across, removed their rifles, and
formed them up in columns which
marched back, each led by a German
in goggles. In order to make future
wars humane it would only be necessary
to introduce the two following rules:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hang">1. No goggles or other eye protection
shall be worn;</p>

<p class="hang">2. No shells shall be used containing
any other substances save ethyl
iodo-acetate (or other lachrymatory
compound) and a small
bursting charge.</p>
</div>

<p>Certainly it is unlikely that such rules
will ever be adopted, but I do contend
that to forbid the use of such substances
is a piece of sentimentalism as
cruel as it is ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Gases of the first group were used in
clouds discharged from cylinders, sometimes
on a front of several miles. They
probably caused at least 20,000 casualties
among unprotected or inadequately
protected British troops. At least a
quarter of these died, and that very
painfully, in many cases after a
struggle for breath lasting several days.
On the other hand, of those who did
not die almost all recovered completely,
and the symptoms of the few who became
permanent invalids were mainly
nervous. Apart, however, from the
extreme terror and agitation produced
by the gassing of uneducated people, I
regard the type of wound produced by
the average shells as, on the whole,
more distressing than the pneumonia
caused by chlorine or phosgene. Besides
being wounded, I have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
buried alive, and on several occasions
in peacetime I have been asphyxiated to
the point of unconsciousness. The pain
and discomfort arising from the other
experiences were utterly negligible compared
with those produced by a good
septic shell-wound.</p>

<p>The first German cloud-gas attack
was in April, 1915, the last in August,
1916, though the British continued
them until the end of that year. They
gradually became more and more ineffective
as the efficiency of the respirators
used on both sides increased.
The first few German attacks were very
well conducted, so far as the liberation
of the gas was concerned, as they were
arranged by Haber, an extremely competent
chemist, who afterwards supervised
their production of explosives.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
On the other hand, the German respirators
were bad to begin with; and later
on were not so good as the British.
This was, apparently, because the most
competent physiologist in Germany
with any knowledge of breathing was
a Jew. This fact was quite well known
in German physiological circles, but
apparently his race prevented the military
authorities from employing him.
The result was that they were unable
to follow up their gas-attacks at all
closely, but had to wait till the cloud
had passed off, by which time resistance
was again possible. That was how the
Germans paid for anti-Semitism. It is
very probable that it lost them the war,
as never again, not even in March,
1918, had they as complete a gap in the
Franco-British Western front as during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the first gas-attack in April, 1915.
It was, indeed, fortunate for the Germans
that the Russians were still more
anti-Semitic than themselves. Hundreds
of thousands of Russian Jews
volunteered for service in 1914. They
were mostly refused, and in no case
granted commissions. They then proceeded
to turn their combative instincts
into other channels, to the no small advantage
of the Germans. If one goes
to what is, perhaps, the opposite extreme
from Russia, one finds the army
of the world’s most democratic nation,
Australia, commanded by a Jew,
Monash, and notes with interest that
the Germans regarded the Australian
troops as, on the whole, the most formidable,
man for man, of all their
opponents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The other reason why the cloud-gas
attacks were indecisive was that the
Germans had relatively few reserves to
put into the gap they made. Their
reserves in April, 1915, were in Poland.
If they had trusted their scientific men
they could certainly have captured
Calais and Boulogne, and probably
have annihilated the British Army.</p>

<p>In addition to clouds released from
cylinders in the trenches, gas-cylinders
were fired from trench-mortars, some
hundreds at a time, into the enemy’s
lines, producing a sudden and dense
cloud of gas before the men had time to
put on their respirators. But these
bombardments, though they caused
many casualties, were never decisive, as
the cloud-attacks would have been, but
for causes which we have discussed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Mustard gas is a very different thing.
It was never used to force a decision by
breaking the enemy’s lines, but to cause
him casualties and deny him the use of
ground. For, after a given area has
been well sprayed with dichlorethyl
sulphide from bursting shells for some
time, it is death to occupy it without a
mask, and the vapour may blister the
skin, while anyone touching the ground
will be certain of a very serious blister.
Someone placed a drop of the liquid on
the chair of the director of the British
chemical warfare department. He ate
his meals off the mantelpiece for a
month. The most interesting thing,
however, about mustard gas is that,
though it caused 150,000 casualties in
the British Army alone, less than 4,000
of these (or 1 in 40) died, while only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
about 700 (or 1 in every 200) became
permanently unfit. Yet the Washington
Conference has solemnly agreed
that the signatory powers are not to
use this substance against one another,
though, of course, they will use such
humane weapons as bayonets, shells,
and incendiary bombs.</p>

<p>It is worth while attempting to
analyse the reasons for this rather
curious decision. First, perhaps, we
must put the complete and shameful
ignorance of most of the politicians and
many of the soldiers who took part in
the Conference. Their ideas of gas
warfare were apparently drawn from
the descriptions of the great German
cloud-gas attacks of 1915, which killed
at least 1 in 4 of their casualties, and
were written up on a large scale for recruiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and political purposes. But it
is the business of politicians and soldiers,
conceivably even of journalists,
to know the truth about such matters
before coming to decisions, or even
impelling others to come to decisions
about them.</p>

<p>To this ignorance, however, there
was joined one of the most hideous
forms of sentimentalism which has ever
supported evil upon earth—the attachment
of the professional soldier to
cruel and obsolete killing machines. I
would remind you of the conduct of
the Chevalier Bayard, whom his contemporary
soldiers described as <i lang="fr">sans
peur et sans reproche</i>. To captured
knights, and even bowmen, he was the
soul of courtesy, but musketeers or
other users of gunpowder who fell into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
his hands were invariably put to death.
It is worth remembering that, until the
invention of gunpowder, fighting had
for many centuries been remarkably
safe for everyone who could afford a
good suit of armour, while the abominable
arquebus and its descendants have
saved the remnants of Christendom
from the Turks, Mongols, and other
paynims who had by Bayard’s time
successfully overwhelmed one half of
its original extent.</p>

<p>I remember an excellent example of
Bayardism in the war. A Turkish airman
had developed considerable flair
for shooting down our observation
balloons. A British officer sent up one
of these latter with a large cargo of
gun-cotton, and blew up the Turk in
question. For this deed he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
severely reprimanded by the local
officer commanding R.A.F. for unsportsmanlike
conduct. This gentleman,
doubtless, felt little objection to
bombing, for example, Turkish transport
columns, consisting mainly of non-combatants
and animals, incapable of
retaliating. (One may remark that
between wounds and thirst perhaps
30,000 Turkish transport animals
perished during our final victory in
Palestine.) But he objected to airmen
being killed except by other airmen.
I, fighting in the mud beneath them,
and exposed to the bombs of both sides
(I was severely wounded by one of our
own), felt differently. An attempt by
the professional soldiers to stereotype
the art of war into the channels which
correspond to the ideas of 1914 might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
lead to a future rather different from
that which I shall venture to predict, a
future in which the military organizations
of the world were overthrown by
the exponents of some other mode of
thinking, employing all the resources of
science, and fighting “dirty.” The
opponents of the present world-order
may, therefore, welcome Bayardism in
their governments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Bayardists have
nobbled a curious assortment of allies
in their so far successful attempt to
prevent the humanization of warfare.
First are a number of out-and-out
pacifists, who object to all war, and
apparently hope to make it more difficult
by restricting the means of fighting
allowed. Some, of course, genuinely
believe that gaseous weapons are more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
cruel than solid ones. Those who know
the facts seem to me to be the victims
of loose-thinking. With them are
associated a group of sentimentalists
who appear to me definitely to be the
Scribes and Pharisees of our age.
These people, who are to be found in
all political parties and most religious
and irreligious sects, are generally willing
(after a decent interval) to accept
any application of science which appears
to them profitable, or any social
institution (such as war) which is
hallowed by use and wont. They salve
their consciences for such behaviour by
attacking, in the name of their god or
their ideals, every novelty, whether in
thought or in action, which presents
any loophole. In particular they are
distinguished by a ferocious opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to, and contempt for, any attempt at
the solution of human problems by
honest and simple intellectual effort.
Mustard gas kills one man for every
forty it puts out of action; shells kill
one for every three; but their god who
compromised with high explosives has
not yet found time to adapt himself to
chemical warfare.</p>

<p>More respectable in every way are
the candid reactionaries, like Lord
Cecil, who believe in their hearts that
in abandoning traditional religion of
the medieval type for scientific thought,
man has definitely chosen the wrong
path, and who fight with their eyes open
against its application. These people
have a case, and are prepared to argue
it. They would honestly desire to give
up the gunpowder of Lazare Carnot for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the sword of Bayard. But one cannot
congratulate them on their associates.</p>

<p>And behind these follow like sheep
the predestined victims of the next war,
the peoples of the civilized nations who
will undergo the extremity of suffering
rather than think for themselves.</p>

<p>How profound and unreasoning the
objection of the military mind to
chemical warfare is can best be judged
by one simple fact. About three years
ago the British regular army gave up
the instruction of every soldier in
defence against hostile gas. For one
thing, speed in adjusting respirators
being of more importance than elegance,
it did not form the basis of a satisfactory
drill, like those curious relics of
eighteenth century musketry which still
occupy so much of the time of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
recruits. But the truth no doubt was
that the officers did not like that sort of
thing. The chemical and physiological
ideas which underlie gas warfare require
a certain effort to understand,
and they do not arise in the study of a
sport, as is the case with those underlying
shooting and motor transport. One
of the first acts of the late Government
was to reinstate some modicum of anti-gas
instruction in the normal training
of the Army. But it may be hoped that
this pernicious and demoralizing teaching
will once more be dropped with the
return to power of one of the gentlemen’s
parties.</p>

<p>Personally, I must confess that I
would go very much further than the
Government, and seriously consider the
provision of gas-masks for the population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of London and other large towns,
and the instruction of school-children
in their use. If this is not done, there
is at least the possibility of a disaster
of the very first magnitude at an early
stage in the next war. It is also one of
the very few military measures which
could hardly be regarded as provocative
by the most ardent of foreign militarists
or British pacifists. At the present
moment, however, this need does not
arise, as the French, who alone could
bomb London, have very slight facilities
for making mustard gas.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the
attitude of our militarists to defence
against gas with their attitude before
the war to a possible German invasion.
The fear of the latter, although the
naval experts always stated that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
impossible on any serious scale, had
been so impressed on the military mind
by the propaganda of the National
Service League and its like before the
war that, from 1914 to 1918 hundreds
of thousands of troops were quite unnecessarily
kept in England. There
however, this very fundamental difference
between a defence against
invasion and a defence against gas.
The one would increase the importance
of the professional soldier: the other
would not. One does not need to be a
very profound psychologist to see in
this fact one reason why the military
authorities dropped anti-gas training,
and why I, being a biochemist and
therefore a person of the type who
would become important if gas war
returned, am advocating its extension.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
As to which of us is justified, I would
suggest that it is more likely to-day that
poisonous gas will be used against
British soldiers or civilians in future
wars than it was in 1912 that Britain
would be invaded by the Germans.</p>

<p>We have seen that a case can be made
out for gas as a weapon on humanitarian
grounds, based on the very small
proportion of killed to casualties from
gas in the war, and especially during
its last year. Against this may be
urged the probability that future research
will produce other gases or
smokes which, as weapons, will be as
cruel as, or more cruel than, the
chlorine and phosgene used in 1915 and
1916. The answer to this is quite
simple. First, as regards gases or
vapours. Only a limited number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
chemical substances are appreciably
volatile, and of their vapours only a
small proportion are poisonous. Now
every chemical substance has a definite
molecular weight. Those with a small
molecular weight, <i>i.e.</i>, whose molecules
are relatively light, are on the whole
the most volatile, <i>i.e.</i>, go most easily
into vapour. Now the large majority
of the possible volatile chemical substances
of small molecular weight, and
therefore relatively simple chemical
composition, are already known. Mustard
gas, for example, was discovered
and its properties described in 1886.
There are probably substances of high
molecular weight whose dense vapours
are even more poisonous than mustard
gas. But the charcoal of our respirators
has the property of adsorbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
heavy molecules of vapour quite independently
of their chemical composition.
It is, therefore, somewhat unlikely,
though not, of course, impossible,
that any very poisonous vapour will
ever be found which will go through a
mask impermeable to mustard gas or
chlorine. It is, to my mind, far more
probable that skin irritants may be discovered
which are even more unpleasant
than mustard gas.</p>

<p>The question of smokes is more
serious. It was the hope of the producers
of irritant smokes that they
would penetrate the gas-masks in
sufficient amounts to cause sneezing
and force their victims to remove their
masks, thus exposing themselves to
greater concentrations of smoke and to
poisonous vapours liberated along with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the smoke. This was the German view
when they introduced the “Blue Cross”
shell in July, 1917. Fortunately, by
that time our defence against gas and
smoke was extremely good, and we had
foreseen the smoke menace and introduced,
between April and June, 1917,
a filter which effectively stopped it in
the concentrations then met in the
field. It is not, however, at all unlikely
that concentrations of smoke will be
produced in the future which will penetrate
our present masks. If our anti-gas
measures are sufficiently neglected
the consequences may, of course, be
very serious.</p>

<p>It would seem likely that the chemical
weapons of the future will not be so
very unlike those of the past. The main
efforts of the soldier who uses them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
will be devoted, first, to blistering his
enemy, secondly, to tiring him out by
forcing him to wear a respirator continuously,
which, of course, enormously
hampers him for doing anything else.</p>

<p>In the Great War mustard gas and
sensory irritant smokes were not used
as the principal weapons of attack or
defence, because the smokes would not
incapacitate everyone in a given area,
though they would make them keep
their respirators on. Mustard gas, on
the other hand, could make any area
absolutely untenable by the defenders,
but the vapour persisted for so many
days that it could not be occupied by the
attackers either. It was mainly used
to produce casualties a few days or
weeks before an attack on the units
which would be defending, and to protect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
the flank of an offensive against
counter-attack. Thus in April, 1918,
Armentières, the original Northern
limit of the German attack in Flanders,
was so heavily shelled with “mustard”
that the gutters in the streets were
reported to be running with it. The
Germans themselves received orders
forbidding them to enter its ruins for
a fortnight.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, mustard gas is so adequate
a weapon that the attempt will
almost certainly be made to use it not
merely for making ground untenable
for both sides, but for gaining it from
the enemy. For this purpose the following
methods suggest themselves.
First, attempts might be made to protect
troops completely from the effect
of gas on their skins by encasing them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
in airtight overalls and gloves. These
were used with a certain amount of
success by machine-gunners in the Great
War, but would hardly be practicable
for attackers, who would, except perhaps
in winter, die of heat-stroke if
encased in such apparatus.</p>

<p>Air-tight tanks with adequate arrangements
for filtering the incoming
air are probably more hopeful, as
mustard gas will not poison motors as
it does men. (The motors would, of
course, have their own air-supply, as it
would hardly be practicable to filter air
in the quantities needed by them.) To
support the tanks and to tackle specially
protected machine-gunners use will
probably be made of immune infantry.
One attack of gas-poisoning, whether
by the lungs or skin, produces no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
immunity to a second attack—in fact,
it generally increases the sensitivity of
the victim. If a vapour is discovered
against which immunity can be conferred,
it will be the most effective
weapon in history as long as its secret
is kept. On the other hand, some
people are naturally immune. The
American Army authorities made a
systematic examination of the susceptibility
of large numbers of recruits.
They found that there was a very
resistant class, comprising 20% of the
white men tried, but no less than 80%
of the negroes. This as intelligible, as
the symptoms of mustard gas, blistering,
and sun-burn are very similar, and
negroes are pretty well immune to sun-burn.
It looks therefore as if, after
a slight preliminary test, it should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
possible to obtain coloured troops who
would all be resistant to mustard gas
blistering in concentrations harmful toward
most white men. Enough resistant
whites are available to officer them.</p>

<p>One sees, then, the possibility of
warfare on somewhat the following
lines:—</p>

<p>Heavy concentrations of artillery
would keep an area say thirty miles in
length and ten in depth continuously
sprayed with mustard gas. After
allowing, say, two days for the development
of blisters, the gassing of the
positions within two or three miles of
the front line is discontinued, but a
long-range bombardment, especially of
roads, goes on. Suddenly, behind the
usual barrage of high explosive shells
appears a line of tanks supported by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
negroes in gas-masks. They meet with
but little opposition in the area still
reeking of gas, and occupy the hostile
lines to a depth of two or three miles.
A counter-attack, even if successful, involves
concentration in an area under
gas-bombardment and enormous casualties
from blistering. The only satisfactory
counter-attack would be from
the air. In this way the side possessing
a big superiority of mustard gas should
be in a position to advance two or three
miles a day.</p>

<p>This kind of tactics was impossible
during the Great War for a very simple
reason. There was not enough mustard
gas. The Germans used a quite surprisingly
complicated process for its
manufacture. When we decided to
follow their example, one of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
chemists (a Cambridge man, I am glad
to say) hit on a vastly cheaper and
speedier method of manufacture. Unfortunately,
our first supplies only arrived
in the field in September, 1918.
There is reason to think that the knowledge
that we were at last about to
develop gas and smoke warfare on a
large scale had a good deal to do with
the acceptance by the Germans of the
armistice conditions.</p>

<p>The reason why we did not use
mustard gas earlier is also simple and
rather instructive.</p>

<p>In 1915 a British chemist proposed
to a General who was concerned with
such questions that the British should
use dichlorethyl sulphide. “Does it
kill?” asked the General. “No,” he
was told, “but it will disable enormous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
numbers of the enemy temporarily.”
“That is no good to us,” said the man
of blood; “we want something that
will kill.” It is interesting to find how
completely the ideas of this worthy
soldier as to the object of war coincided
with those of the average intelligent
child of five years old. I may remind
you that Clausewitz held the view that
the object of war was to impose one’s
will upon the enemy. This idea would,
however, appear to have been too
abstract, too complicated, or too
humanitarian for the British military
mind. At any rate, it had its fill of
killing. It was not, therefore, until the
Germans had demonstrated upon the
persons of some tens of thousands of
British soldiers (we had 14,000 casualties,
though with only 400 deaths, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the first three weeks of the mustard
gas war) that there was something to
be said for a weapon that was not
primarily designed to kill, that we began
to use it.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that mustard gas
would enable an army to gain ground
with far less killed on either side than
the methods used in the late war, and
would tend to establish a war of movement
leading to a fairly rapid decision,
as in the campaigns of the past. It
would not much upset the present
balance of power, Germany’s chemical
industry being counterpoised by French
negro troops. Indians may be expected
to be nearly as immune as negroes.</p>

<p>And clearly, the more war is complicated,
the more unimportant become
semi-civilized powers, such as Turkey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and Russia, even as allies. The Turks
were seldom capable of organizing a
combined attack by any number greater
than a battalion, or a shoot by anything
larger than a battery. Yet small groups
of them fought very well, and their
individual guns made very good shooting.
But gas-warfare demands organization,
both of attack and defence—attack,
because one tries to keep up a
certain concentration of vapour over a
whole large area rather than to knock
out given groups of men; defence,
because respirators and discipline in
wearing them must be perfect. I need
not say that in the Great War our
military leaders strongly deprecated the
use of gas against the Turks, on the
ground, I believe, that the latter were
“gentlemen.” They showed their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
gentlemanly character by such acts as
the killing of 45% of the prisoners
taken at Kut-el-Amara, not to mention
some millions of Greeks and Armenians
who had the misfortune to be Christians.
But they never used gas: so
perhaps they may have preserved their
quality of gentlemen in the eyes of our
Bayardists.</p>

<p>I claim, then, that the use of mustard
gas in war on the largest possible scale
would render it less expensive of life
and property, shorter, and more dependent
on brains rather than numbers.
We are often told the exact opposite,
that it will make it more barbarous and
indecisive, and lead to the wiping out
of the population of whole cities. Let
us consider for a moment this latter
allegation. Can aeroplanes do more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
against a hostile town with gas than
with high explosive and incendiary
bombs? We were threatened with gas
bombs during the war, and certain
London pharmacists made very large
sums by the sale of alleged anti-gas
masks. It could be, and was, urged at
the time that as the carrying of these
curious objects seemed to calm the
civilian population in a moment of
national emergency, they served a useful
purpose. The same argument has
been brought forward on behalf of
amulets and other pious frauds sold in
the name of religion. In the case of
the above gas-masks, they inspired such
faith (for they had a better finish than
the official pattern and looked like one’s
idea of what a gas-mask ought to be)
that some thousands were sent out by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
fond relatives to soldiers at the front,
a number of whom in consequence
perished miserably.</p>

<p>Was there anything in the gas-bomb
scare? In the first place, many otherwise
well-informed people have very
erroneous views as to the poisonousness
of gases. Gases are dangerous in the
laboratory or factory if they kill without
giving warning by odour and irritation;
but gases of this kind, such as
carbon monoxide and hydrogen arsenide,
have to be present, in order to kill,
in concentrations which cannot practically
be produced in the open. The
insidiousness of hydrogen arsenide has,
however, so alarmed chemists that a
tradition persists of a man having been
killed by a single bubble of it, while
they are so afraid of smelling carbon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
monoxide that it is generally stated to
be inodorous. Besides errors due to
this cause, there were errors of arithmetic.
In one calculation which was
made to show how easily London could
be poisoned a decimal point went astray
in one place! As the calculation was
concerned with volumes of gas, the
result came out as 10 metres cubed or
1,000 cubic metres, in place of one.
For this reason it appeared that ten
aeroplanes could do the damage which
would actually have required ten
thousand. However, most of the
prophets of disaster from gas-bombs
made no calculation at all. Let us try
to make a rough one. On the nights of
March 11th to March 14th, 1918, just
before the great offensive of March
21st, the Germans fired 150,000 mustard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
gas shells into the villages and
valleys of the Cambrai salient, an area
of about twenty square miles, the same
as that of central London. This caused
4,500 casualties, of whom only fifty
died (all of them because they took off
their respirators too soon). The area
was not evacuated. In central London,
if the population had had gas-masks,
the casualties would have been perhaps
ten times greater. But we have to
compare this hypothetical air-raid, not
with any raid that actually occurred,
but with a bombardment of 150,000
high-explosive shells or their equivalent
in bombs. This would hardly have left
a house in central London untouched,
and the dead would have been numbered
not in hundreds, but in tens of
thousands. Such an attack would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
required the visits on repeated nights
of something like 1,000 aeroplanes.
Such a number is not yet a practical
possibility. We are, perhaps, inclined
to underestimate the potentialities of
town-bombing with high explosive and
incendiary bombs. In London, for
example, there were never too many
big fires started at any given time for
the fire-brigades to deal with. An
attack by ten or twenty times as many
aeroplanes as ever bombed London
simultaneously might well ring round
a given area fairly completely with
wrecked streets or burning houses, in
which case most of the buildings and
a good proportion of the inhabitants
would perish. In one or two air-raids
on other towns it seems probable that
the Germans were not far from outstripping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the capacities of the fire-brigades
and producing very large conflagrations.</p>

<p>The reasons why explosives are more
likely to be effective than poison on a
town are as follows. Houses are far
more vulnerable to explosives than
earthworks, and do far more damage
to their occupants in collapsing, besides
being inflammable. And, on the
other hand, they contain far more
refuges which are nearly gas-proof. A
shut room on a first or second floor
would be nearly proof against gas released
in the neighbourhood if it had
not got a lighted fire to drag contaminated
air from outside into it. Moreover,
civilians could, and would, rapidly
evacuate an area which has been heavily
soaked with mustard gas, whereas soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
have to stay on at the risk of
their lives.</p>

<p>Gas-bombs would certainly be far
less effective than high-explosives on a
town whose inhabitants were provided
with respirators, probably even if they
were unprovided. But, so long as London
is undefended in this respect, it
constitutes a standing temptation to any
power desirous of making this kind of
experiment. Judging from experience,
there is no doubt that a gas or smoke
attack from the air would occasion a
first-class panic. The introduction of
each new chemical weapon produced
great terror, as did even such a militarily
unimportant (though cruel)
weapon as the <i lang="de">Flammenwerfer</i> (flame-projector).
This was certainly due to
ignorance. The French Colonial troops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
who were caught in the first cloud-gas
attack were far more frightened than
the Canadians, and appear to have had
far more casualties, although they
mostly ran away: which the Canadians
did not. For the Canadians made some
attempts to improvise respirators, and
almost any damp fabric will reduce the
concentration of chlorine passing
through it to half or less. They also
breathed less because they did not run.
As a matter of fact, a most efficient
respirator against chlorine (though
whether against mustard gas I do not
know) can be made by knocking the
bottom off a bottle, filling it with loose
earth, placing its neck in the mouth,
and breathing through it. Very great
alarm was caused by the first mustard
gas bombardments in France, as no one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
had ever seen anything resembling the
blisters it caused. But very soon
familiarity bred contempt, or even
liking, for aeroplanes dropped sheaves
of pamphlets explaining how any soldier
tired of the war could become a
casualty without danger either of death
or detection by allowing earth contaminated
with mustard gas to touch
the skin or the clothing. A good many
wound-stripes were earned by this
simple and up-to-date method, though,
as we had the superiority in the air and
the German soldiers were both more
tired and more confiding than our own,
the German casualties from this cause
were probably still greater. But let us
tell our civilian population before and
not after they are attacked with blistering
gases that the blisters produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
are considerably less dangerous than
measles. It was predicted during the
war that the survivors of lung-irritant
gases would get consumption, while
those burned by mustard gas would
develop cancer. This has not happened,
but it is the sort of rumour that easily
starts.</p>

<p>For, after all, our greatest weapon in
chemical warfare is not gas, but education,
and education of all classes. By
education I mean a process which puts
people in general in touch with the
thought of the abler minds of their own
and past times, whether in literature or
art, in science, mathematics, or music.
An educated man knows enough of
science, for example, to be able to
distinguish a gas from a smoke, or a
Grindell-Matthews from a Marconi,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
even if he is not thoroughly versed in
the kinetic theory of gases or the laws
governing radiation through the ether.
Educated men are rather rare. It will
be worth while giving some examples
of how our uneducated politicians and
soldiers failed to adjust themselves to
the scientific thought of their contemporaries.</p>

<p>In April, 1915, a relatively educated
member of the Government got hold of
a physiologist, whose name I suppress
as he is a modest man. He found
a rather curious state of affairs. On
the <i>Emden</i>, a German cruiser captured
in the Indian Ocean, a German sailor
had been found in possession of a pad
of lint with tapes to tie in front of his
mouth. It did not even cover his nose,
and, though it might or might not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
been of some value against smoke, it
was of none at all against gas. There
was, however, a very prevalent belief at
that time, and may be still, for all that
I know, that German men of science
were vastly superior to British. It is
perfectly true that there are more of
them, but I think that their average
attainments in the last forty years have
been, if anything, slightly below those
of our own. So hypnotized, however,
were some of the authorities in this
country by this theory that it was being
proposed to issue these articles to our
troops. After pointing out their uselessness,
the physiologist in question
was rushed over to France in a destroyer,
along with a chemist. He
identified the gas used by the Germans
as chlorine. On his return, he got a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
cylinder of that gas, let some into an
air-tight chamber, and devised a rough
respirator which would keep most of it
out, trying various possible methods on
himself. On his return to the War
Office, rather short of breath from the
chlorine he had breathed, he found to
his horror that the appeal to the women
of England for home-made respirators
had been issued. Their design was apparently
based on the captured German
one, which had very probably been
made on the <i>Emden</i>. As they were
quite useless, he secured a promise that
they would not be sent out to France.
Things were not made easier by the
opinion held in high military quarters
that, offence being more important than
defence, the great thing was to reply to
the Germans by gassing them. As,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
however, this could not be done in less
than five months, while respirators
could easily be made in a week, it led
to delay at a somewhat vital moment.
Finally every important decision taken
in England had to pass through the
hands of Lord Kitchener, who naturally
had not time to weigh the arguments
at all fully. It is not my intention to
attack Lord Kitchener: that the war
could be carried on at all under such a
system proves that he was a great man.
But, if he had managed to delegate
some of his powers, he would have
proved himself a greater. As the result
of all this delay, a great many of the
first respirators had to be made in
France.</p>

<p>Convalescent soldiers and the nuns
in a convent on the Mont des Cats were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
conscripted to make respirators, which,
if inelegant, were fairly efficient. Unfortunately,
consignments of “Women
of England” and other home-made
respirators were continually appearing
in France, and every now and then led
to a battalion or so being wiped out. I
am able to give these details, because
at this time I, who before and after
was an honest infantry bombing-officer,
made my brief incursion into chemical
warfare. I arrived at St. Omer from
my comfortable trench as being a
person accustomed to poisonous gases
in civil life. In a large school there,
converted into a hospital, there was a
small glass-fronted room, like a miniature
greenhouse, into which known
volumes of chlorine were liberated. We
had to compare the effects on ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of various quantities with and without
respirators. It stung the eyes and
produced a tendency to gasp and cough
when breathed. For this reason trained
physiologists had to be employed. An
ordinary soldier would probably restrain
his tendency to gasp, cough and
throw himself about if he were working
a machine-gun in a battle, but could
not do so in a laboratory experiment
with nothing to take his mind off his
own feelings. An experienced physiologist
has more self-control. It was
also necessary to see if one could run
or work hard in the respirators, so we
had a wheel of some kind to turn by
hand in the gas chamber, not to mention
doing fifty-yard sprints in respirators
outside. As each of us got
sufficiently affected by gas to render his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
lungs unduly irritable, another would
take his place. None of us was much
the worse for the gas, or in any real
danger, as we knew where to stop, but
some had to go to bed for a few days,
and I was very short of breath and
incapable of running for a month or so.
This work, which was mainly done by
civilians, was rewarded by the grant of
the Military Cross to the brilliant young
officer who used to open the door of the
motor-car of the medical General who
occasionally visited the experiments.
The soldiers who took part in them
could, however, for some time be distinguished
by the peculiar green colour
of their brass buttons due to the action
of the gas.</p>

<p>Even when arrangements had been
made for the manufacture of respirators<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
in England, the supply suddenly
dried up. It was found that the girls
who made them were working as best
they could with raw and bleeding
fingers, and London was being scoured
for rubber gloves. Someone had altered
the formula of the mixture in
which the respirators were dipped by
substituting for carbonate of soda caustic
soda, which has the property of
dissolving the human skin. His name,
needless to say, does not appear in the
official history.</p>

<p>Such were some of the difficulties
which we incurred in our anti-gas work,
through the ignorance of highly-placed
persons. As, however, our defensive
(though not our offensive) measures
were ultimately better than those of any
other nation, things must have been still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
worse elsewhere. The success of our
respirators was largely due to one man,
Harrison, whose name is insufficiently
known to his countrymen. He was an
analytical chemist, and author of that
admirable and too little read work
<cite>Secret Remedies</cite> (published by the
British Medical Association). He
enlisted as a private, but was a
Lieutenant-Colonel when he died of
influenza and overwork in 1918.</p>

<p>Naturally the ignorance of our private
soldiers was of an even more
abysmal character. In the early days
they often removed the respirators from
their faces and tied them around their
chests, as it was there that they felt the
effects of the gas. Again in 1917 80%
of the mustard-gas cases vomited, while
this symptom was rare in 1918. Apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
it took five months for the
British Army to realize that gas-poisoning
did not necessarily mean poisoning
through the stomach.</p>

<p>If, then, in future wars we are to
avoid gross mismanagement in high
places, and panic and stupidity among
the masses, it is essential that everyone
should learn a little elementary science,
that politicians and soldiers should not
be proud of their ignorance of it, that
ordinary men and women should not
be ashamed or afraid of knowing something
of the working of their own
bodies. If we persist in the belief that
we can be saved by patriotism or social
reforms, or by military preparation of
the type which would have sufficed in
former struggles, we shall go down before
some nation of more realistic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
views. We do not know what type of
scientific knowledge will be needed: we
can be certain that some type will be.
The British are a tired people: they
like to rest “in breathless quiet after all
their ills,” and to pin their faith to the
promises of leaders whose eyes are fixed
on the past. It has all happened before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>The Roman and Spanish Empires
appear to have perished largely from
intellectual torpor. Are we to go the
same way?</p>

<p>We have got to get over our distaste
for scientific thought and scientific
method. To take an example from the
war, the physiologists at the experimental
ground at Porton, in Hampshire,
had considerable difficulty in
working with a good many soldiers because
the latter objected so strongly to
experiments on animals, and did not
conceal their contempt for people who
performed them. And yet these soldiers
would have had no hesitation in
shelling the horses of hostile gun-teams,
and the vast majority of them were in
the habit of shooting animals for sport.
I have never known a physiologist who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
went in for shooting animals: physiologists
know too much of the processes
which occur in a wounded beast or bird
that creeps away to die. And, though
I have seen a good many scientific
experiments on animals, I have never
seen one which, so far as concerns the
pain given, I should object to having
performed on myself. That this attitude
is not unusual would appear from
the following experiment described by
the director of the Porton experimental
ground, in which he wished to compare
the effects of hydrocyanic (or prussic)
acid gas on himself and a dog. They
both entered a chamber containing 1
part in 2,000 of the gas.</p>

<p>“In order (he writes) that the experiment
might be as fair as possible
and that my respiration should be relatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
as active as that of the dog, I
remained standing, and took a few steps
from time to time while I was in the
chamber. In about thirty seconds the
dog began to get unsteady, and in fifty-five
seconds it dropped on the floor and
commenced the characteristic distressing
respiration which heralds death
from cyanide poisoning. One minute
thirty-five seconds after the commencement
the animal’s body was carried out,
respiration having ceased and the dog
being apparently dead. I then left the
chamber. As regards the result upon
myself, the only real effect was a momentary
giddiness when I turned my
head quickly. This lasted about a year,
and then vanished. For some time it
was difficult to concentrate on anything
for any length of time. It is hard to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
say to what extent this was due to the
experiment.”</p>

<p>As the result of this work, hydrocyanic
acid was given up for use in the
field, as phosgene is effective at fifty
times this dilution, and mustard gas at
one thousand times.</p>

<p>One of the grounds given for objection
to science is that science is
responsible for such horrors as those of
the late war. “You scientific men (we
are told) never think of the possible
application of your discoveries. You
do not mind whether they are used to
kill or to cure. Your method of thinking,
doubtless satisfactory when dealing
with molecules and atoms, renders
you insensible to the difference between
right and wrong. And so you devise
the means of universal destruction, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
sell them into the hands of unrighteous
and bloody-minded men.”</p>

<p>I note that the people who make
these remarks do not refuse to travel
by railway or motor-car, to use electric
light, or to read mechanically printed
newspapers. Nor do they install a well
in their back-gardens to enjoy drinking
the richer water of a pre-scientific age,
with its interesting and variegated
fauna. But it is quite easy to show
that the destructive and horrible nature
of modern warfare is due, not to the
weapons used, but largely to the other
applications of science which constitute
the material basis of our civilization.
Let us imagine the Great War fought
with all our means of transport and
preventive medicine, but no weapons
more complicated than swords, spears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
and possibly a few bows. With fewer
munitions the armies could have been
mobilized even more rapidly, and more
men put in the fighting line. The
Germans would probably have tried, as
they tried in 1914, to bring about a
“Schlacht ohne Morgen,” a battle on
reversed fronts modelled on Cannae.
The fighting would probably have been
about as severe as at Cannae, and men
would have been fighting in close order,
ten or twenty deep, along a hundred-mile
front. No doubt it would have
been over sooner, but the losses would
probably have been just as great. The
French and Germans would doubtless
both have gone on fighting until at least
half their armies had become casualties,
and, with four years’ fighting compressed
into as many weeks, it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
have been impossible to tend more than
a fraction of the wounded. The chief
difference might have been that the
Russians would have been victorious by
mere weight of numbers, and the
French defeated. In former wars
slaughter was limited by the fact that
large armies could not be fed, and developed
epidemic diseases. They also
moved very slowly. So it took twenty-three
years (from 1792 to 1815) to
wear down the resistance of the French
nation. Moreover, the Great War was
the first since the Second Punic War of
the 3rd century B. C. between two great
civilized nations, each fighting with all
its might. This fact accounts for its
ferocity. Modern transport and hygiene
made its scale possible; the
weapons used merely served to prolong
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>The objection to scientific weapons
such as the gases of the late war, and
such new devices as may be employed
in the next, is essentially an objection
to the unknown. Fighting with lances
or guns, one can calculate, or thinks one
can calculate, one’s chances. But with
gas or rays or microbes one has an
altogether different state of affairs.
Poisonous gas had a great moral effect,
just because it was new, and incomprehensible.
As long as we permit ourselves
to be afraid of the novel and
unknown, there will be a very great
temptation to use novel and unknown
weapons against us. Now, terror of
the unknown is thoroughly right and
rational so long as we believe that the
prince of this world is a malignant
being. But it is not justifiable if we
believe that the world is the expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of a power friendly to our aspirations,
or if we are atheists and hold that it
is neutral and indifferent to human
ideals.</p>

<p>It will by now have become clear to
you that I am writing somewhat parabolically.
What I have said about
mustard gas might be applied, <i lang="la">mutatis
mutandis</i>, to most other applications of
science to human life. They can all,
I think, be abused, but none perhaps is
always evil; and many, like mustard
gas, when we have got over our first
not very rational objection to them, turn
out to be, on the whole, good. If it is
right for me to fight my enemy with a
sword, it is right for me to fight him
with mustard gas: if the one is wrong,
so is the other. But I have no sympathy
whatever for Mr. Facing-both-ways<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
when he says that, though he is
prepared on occasion to fight, he will
not use these nasty new-fangled
weapons. Of course I am not suggesting
that we should violate or prepare
to violate the Washington Agreement
on this subject. I do, however,
believe that we ought to denounce it at
the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p>Such are the facts about chemical
warfare. They will not be believed
because a belief in them would do
violence to the sentiments of most
people. They will not be promulgated,
as there is no money to be made out of
them. (Chemical manufacturers make
both high explosive and mustard gas,
and the former more easily.) The
views which I have expressed do not
coexist in the mind of any party leader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
or newspaper proprietor, and must
therefore be those of a crank. But
until some stronger argument can be
waged against them than that they are
unusual and unpleasant, there remains
the possibility that they are true.</p>
